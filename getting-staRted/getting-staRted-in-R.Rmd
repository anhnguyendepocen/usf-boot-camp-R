# The R Universe

## What is R?

- R is an *Open Source* and free programming language for statistical computing and graphics, based on it predecessor S.

- Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux

- Under active development

- R can be easily extended with "packages": 
  - code, data and documentation

## Why use R?

- Free and open source

- Excellent and robust community

- One of the most popular tools for data analysis

- Growing popularity in science and hacking

## Pros of using R

- Available on any platform

- Source code is easy to read

- Lots of work being done in R now, with an excellent and open professional and academic community

- Plays nicely with many other packages (SPSS, SAS)

- Bleeding edge analyses not available in proprietary packages

## Some downsides of R

- Older language that can be a little quirky

- User-~~driven~~ supplied features

- It's a programming language, not a point-and-click solution

- Slower than compiled languages
    - To speed up R you vectorize
    - Opposite of other languages

## Take it for a quick spin

```{r easy-stuff}

2==2
```

## Setting up RStudio

- Under settings, move panes to where you want them to be

- Change font colors, etc

- Browse to downloaded companion script in **Files** pane

- Open script and set working directory

## Where to get help

- Every R packages comes with documentation and examples
    - Try `?summary` and `??regression`
    - RStudio + tab completion = FTW!

- Get help online
    - [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com)
    - Google (add `in R` or `R stats` to your query)
    - [RSeek](http://www.rseek.org/)

- For really odd messages, copy and paste error message into Google

## Working directory

Set working directory with

```r
setwd("path/to/directory/")
```

Check to see where you are with

```r
getwd()
```

## Packages

Install packages[^1]

```r
install.packages(ggplot2)
```

Load packages

```r
library(ggplot2)
```

Find packages on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) or [Rdocumentation](http://www.rdocumentation.org/). Or

```r
?ggplot
```

[^1]: Windows users need to run RStudio with System Administrator privileges.


# Basics of the language

## Basic Operators

```r
2 + 2
2/2
2*2
2^2
2 == 2
42 >= 2
2 <= 42
2 != 42
23 %/% 2
23 %% 2
```

## Key Symbols

```{r key-symbols}
x <- 10         # Assigment operator
y <- 1:x        # Sequence
y[2]            # Element selection
"str" == 'str'  # Strings
```

## Functions

Functions have the form `functionName(arg1, arg2, ...)` and arguments always go inside the parenthesis.

Define a function:

```{r functions}
fun <- function(x=0){
  return(x+42)
}
fun(8)
```

## Data types

```r
1L          # integer
1.0         # numeric
'1'         # character
TRUE == 1   # logical
FALSE == 0  # logical
NA          # NA
factor()    # factor
```

You can check to see what type a variable is with `class(x)` or `is.numeric()`.

# Data Structures

## Vectors

Basic data type is a vector, built with `c()` for **concatenate**.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(6:10)
```


## Matrices: binding vectors

Matrices can be built by row binding or column binding vectors:

```{r}
cbind(x,y)   # 5 x 2 matrix
rbind(x,y)   # 2 x 5 matrix
```

## Matrices: matrix function

Or you can build a matrix using the `matrix()` function:

```{r matrix}
matrix(1:10, nrow=2, ncol=5, byrow=TRUE)
```

## Coercion

Vectors and matrices need to have elements of the same type, so R pushes mismatched elements to the best common type.

```{r}
c('a', 2)
c(1L, 1.0)
c(1L, 1.1)
```


## Recycling

Recycling occurs when a vector has mismatched dimensions. R will fill in dimensions by *repeating* a vector from the beginning.

```{r}
matrix(1:5, nrow=2, ncol=5, byrow=FALSE)
```


## Factors

Factors are a special (at times frustrating) data type in R.

```{r}
x <- rep(1:3, 2)
x
x <- factor(x, levels=c(1, 2, 3), 
            labels=c('Bad', 'Good', 'Best'))
x
```

## Ordering factors

Order of factors is important for things like plot type, output, etc. Also factors are really two things tied together: the data itself and the labels.

```{r}
x[order(x)]
x[order(x, decreasing=T)]
```

## Ordering factor labels

That reordered the elements of `x`, but not the factor levels.

Compare:

```{r}
factor(x, levels=c('Best', 'Good', 'Bad'))
factor(x, labels=c('Best', 'Good', 'Bad'))
```

## Squashing factors

What if you want your drop the "factor" and keep the data?

**Keep the numbers**

```{r}
as.numeric(x)
```

**Keep the labels**

```{r}
as.character(x)
```

## Lists

Lists are arbitrary collections of objects. They don't have to be the same type or element or have the same dimensions.

```{r}
mylist <-  list(vec = 1:5, str = "Strings!")
mylist
```

## Finding list elements

Use double brackets to return the list item or the `$` operator.

```{r}
mylist[[1]]
mylist$str
mylist$vec[2]
```

## Data frames

Data frames are like matrices, but better. Column vectors are *not* required to be the same type, so they can handle diverse data.

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
data(diamonds, 'ggplot2')
head(diamonds)
```
