Title
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r summary}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot-cars, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

Or you can make boxplots with labels:

```{r hist-cars, fig.cap='My special cars histogram'}
boxplot(cars)
```

Or we can embed numbers and things inside text. For example, the mean stopping distance for cars traveling faster than 11 miles per hour was 
`r mean(cars[cars$speed > 10, 'dist'])` mph.

```{r mtcars-table, results='asis'}
kable(head(mtcars))
```
